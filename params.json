  "body": "### Questing.lua\r\nQuesting.lua is a script for [PROShine](https://proshine-bot.ml) that plays Pokemon Revolution Online for you from the very Start to as far as possible.\r\n\r\n### How To Use\r\nTo use Questing.lua, simply [download the latest version](https://github.com/g0ldPRO/Questing.lua/archive/master.zip), unzip it in your PROShine *Scripts* folder and, optionally, edit the configuration file `config.lua`.\r\nThen open the `Questing.lua` root file from PROShine.\r\n\r\n### How Far Does It Go\r\nTo check how far Questing.lua is going, you can check [the Quests files of each region](http://g0ldpro.github.io/Questing.lua/), alternatively you can check the [QuestManager.lua](https://github.com/g0ldPRO/Questing.lua/blob/master/Quests/QuestManager.lua) where all the quests are loaded and sorted.\r\n\r\n### Contribute\r\nYou can create your own quests. A [template quest file](https://github.com/g0ldPRO/Questing.lua/blob/master/Quests/TemplateQuest.lua) is updated frequently to help you.\r\n\r\nIf you have a good knowledge of Lua you can improve the structure of the code and create pull requests. However I would advise creating a ticket on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/g0ldPRO/Questing.lua/issues) to discuss new ideas.\r\n\r\nQuesting.lua could also use some other advanced scripts to manage the fights, the team setup or a global path finding script. If you want to work on such complicated and heavy scripts, do not hesitate to contact me, preferably via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/g0ldPRO/Questing.lua/issues).\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nQuesting.lua is made by g0ld (@g0ldPRO) and is under the *Do What The Fuck You Want To* pubic license.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you encounter any bug, please use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/g0ldPRO/Questing.lua/issues) with as many details as possible to reproduce the bug.\r\n\r\nNote that the bug report section of the PROShine forum concerns only the PROShine software, not this script.\r\n\r\nYou can get assistance in the [PROShine forum](https://proshine-bot.ml/viewforum.php?id=4).\r\n",
